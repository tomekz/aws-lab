Set up the EC2 cluster:

* [ ] Launch EC2 instances with the desired instance type, operating system, and configuration. Ensure that the instances have appropriate security groups, IAM roles, and network settings.
* [ ] Install Docker on each EC2 instance to facilitate containerization.
    * [ ] run `ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker` to install the docker collection

Build Docker images for each microservice:
* [ ] For each microservice (User Service, Email Service, Notification Service, and Feed Service), create a Dockerfile that defines the container image.
* [ ] Use the appropriate base image for Go applications and specify the necessary dependencies and build instructions.
* [ ] Build the Docker image for each microservice using a command like docker build -t <image-name> ..

Set up Kafka on the EC2 cluster:

* [ ] Install Kafka on one or more EC2 instances within the cluster. Follow the Kafka documentation or use a tool like Confluent Platform to simplify the setup process.
* [ ] Configure Kafka to use multiple topics, including the "user-events" topic in this example.
* [ ] Ensure that the Kafka instances have sufficient resources and are properly networked within the EC2 cluster.

Deploy microservices on the EC2 cluster:

* [ ] Create deployment scripts or use an orchestration tool like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to manage the deployment process.
* [ ] Launch containers for each microservice on the EC2 instances using the Docker images built earlier.
* [ ] Configure the microservices to connect to the appropriate Kafka broker(s) and subscribe to the relevant topics.

Set up load balancing and networking:

* [ ] Configure a load balancer (e.g., Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute incoming traffic across the EC2 instances running the microservices.
* [ ] Ensure that the load balancer is properly configured to handle the gRPC communication ports for each microservice.

Configure security:

* [ ] Apply security best practices to secure the EC2 instances, including using security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, configuring SSL/TLS for gRPC communication, and securing access to Kafka and other services.

Monitor and scale:

* [ ] Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the health and performance of the deployed system. Use tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, or ELK stack for monitoring and log analysis.
* [ ] Set up autoscaling policies to automatically scale the EC2 cluster based on resource utilization or other metrics.

Test and troubleshoot:

* [ ] Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the deployed system is functioning as expected. Perform integration tests, load tests, and simulate failure scenarios to verify the system's resilience.
* [ ] Monitor logs and metrics to identify any issues or bottlenecks and troubleshoot them accordingly.
